        Positive Attributes Essay<br>
        -Changhao Liu
    </div>

    <p>It is an unusual assignment that we ask others to collect our strengths, abilities, and potential. In general, we don't often talk to people about our strengths because it is considered a sign of lack of humility. This opportunity gave me a chance to see myself anew from the perspective of others. It was a novel experience.</p>

    <p>During this time, I invited some of my relatives and close friends to write about my strengths. This included my parents, classmates I met in the U.S., and former friends in China. Most of them responded positively to me and gave me valuable feedback. I have summarized them and come up with the following qualities that I think best represent my strengths.</p>

    <div class="attribute">
        <div class="attribute-title">1. Warm-hearted</div>
        <p>"He is always willing to help people, whether it is simple things such as picking up mail or helping with my move to a new place." "Liu helped me solve a major related problem, as we are studying the same major." I am not stingy in helping others. This is an important reason why people are happy to be associated with me. This is something that will help me a lot with my relationships in the future. It can be more conducive to maintaining a good relationship with colleagues at work. But I'm not good at rejection. I should know how to reject appropriately, especially some unconscionable requests. Otherwise, it will sacrifice a lot of my personal time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="attribute">
        <div class="attribute-title">2. Patient, Good Listener</div>
        <p>"Changhao is also a good listener, he can be talkative if he wants to, but he often chooses to listen when some of his friends can't stop talking." I am a rather introverted person. I prefer to listen and give feedback rather than actively talk. Therefore, my friends love to talk to me about their thoughts and feelings. I also comfort or give them some advice. I once also had the idea of becoming a counselor. In the future, this is something that allows me to better absorb information from others and listen to their opinions. At the same time, it also makes others feel respected and thus contributes to the maintenance of interpersonal relationships. But I also need to be more proactive, so that I can fight for more opportunities.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="attribute">
        <div class="attribute-title">3. Dauntless</div>
        <p>"You participated in the competition of the top ten singers in your second and third year of high school. You will carefully prepare songs, polish them repeatedly, ask others for help to show your best works, and finally win awards." "You participated in the campus top ten singers competition, facing many excellent singers, you were not afraid and did well." This point is the most surprising comment for me. Strictly speaking, this is not in line with my usual character. For most of the previous time, I am a person who is not bold enough to show and challenge myself. But there will be times when I want to change myself. The singing competition mentioned in the feedback above is a good example. I'm glad I made that decision when I was in high school. Because of my passion for singing and my willingness to change myself, I signed up for the school's singer competition and did well through my efforts. At that time, my parents, teachers, and classmates were surprised by this. This experience has greatly changed my mindset and made me more confident to present myself. I am much better now than I was before, but still can't live up to this comment from my friends. However, it is still what I am striving for. I hope to challenge myself bravely in the future and do more challenging things.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="attribute">
        <div class="attribute-title">4. Good Emotional Control</div>
        <p>This point is not mentioned by my friends, but I still think it is worth mentioning. When something bad happens, it won't make me feel bad inside for a long time. I will quickly self-soothe and self-resolve. It's hard to encounter something that makes me depressed. I think this will make me better face and solve the difficulties in the future.</p>
    </div>

    <p>By summarizing and analyzing my own strengths, it allows me to have a more comprehensive understanding of myself and allows me to identify what I need to improve. This assignment has benefited me a lot.</p>

        The Morality of Eating Meat
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Meat, as a kind of food, plays an important role in most people’s diet. However, because it is taken from animals, the morality of eating meat is always a hot topic of discussion. Some people think it is immoral to eat meat. They think the animal is spiritual. It is cruel to kill them and get their flesh. The other don’t think so. They think meat is a kind of indispensable food. Some of them even don’t take the lives of animals seriously. The most typical is Descartes, he thought animals are just unfeeling machines. So is it moral to eat meat? In my opinion, eating meat itself is reasonable and normal. It is unsuitable to regard eating meat as immoral behavior.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>The definition of morality is principles concerning the distinction between right and wrong or good and bad behavior. When we talk about morality, we are always judging right and wrong. We tend to take a black-and-white position when discussing whether someone doing something is immoral. However, Can we simply define eating meat as an immoral behavior? I don't think that's a fair assertion.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Based on history and science, humans have had a deep connection with meat since ancient times. At the very beginning, our human ancestors that live in lush forests mainly ate fruits, leaves, seeds, flowers, etc. However, between 2.6 and 2.5 million years ago, as the climate got significantly hotter and drier, green plants became scarcer. They have to find new sources of energy. As the grasslands thriving, they start to eat animals to survive. “Once humans shifted to even occasional meat eating, it didn’t take long to make it a major part of our diet.” Said by Dave Roos. “Zaraska says there’s ample archaeological evidence that by 2 million years ago the first Homo species were actively eating meat on a regular basis.” (Roos, 2019) Our ancestors survived by eating meat and gradually formed meat-eating habits. Gifts what meat brings us is more than just survival. It also gives us the opportunity of evolution. As a new study in Nature makes clear, it’s entirely possible that without an early diet that included animal protein from meat, we wouldn’t even have become human. Jeffrey Kluger described the study in detail in his article published in Time. “They found that it required from 39% to 46% less force to chew and swallow processed meat than processed root foods.” said by Jeffrey. Kluger. (Kluger, 2016) It saved the amount of time and effort to chew food. Dave Roos also confirmed it from another perspective: “When humans began adding meat to their diet, there was less of a need for a long digestive tract equipped for processing lots of plant matter. Slowly, over hundreds of thousands of years, the human gut shrunk. This freed up energy to be spent on the brain, which grew explosively in size.” Overall, eating meat saved a large amount of energy from chowing and digesting thus provided more energy to feed our growing brains. This has had a crucial impact on the evolution of human beings and even the development of human civilization.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>While eating meat benefits us, we are also adapting to eating meat. “We have incisors for tearing meat, and molars for grinding it. If we were meant to subsist on vegetables alone, our digestive system would be similar to that of the cow, with four stomachs and the ability to ferment cellulose in order to break down plant material.” said by Kadya Araki. (Araki, 2021). “Our genes were developed before the agricultural revolution, when we were not only meat-eaters, but enthusiastic ones at that. On top of that, the human genome has changed less than 0.02% in the last 40,000 years. Our bodies were genetically programed for optimal functioning on a diet including meat, and that programming has not changed.” She shows us the fact that our current dental and digestive systems are compatible with meat-eaters. According to the history information I mentioned above, her natural carnivore comment was a bit arbitrary. However, it is reasonable to assume that our current body structure is the result of our bodies adapting to a meat diet because our present body exhibits carnivorous characteristics. What’s more, as she mentioned, the structure is long-lasting. It was cumulative from the past and will continue to affect us.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>All of these prove our reasonableness of eating meat. Although we may not be natural carnivores, (professionally speaking, we are omnivores) due to various factors, we are tightly connected to meat. Meat benefited us while we adapted to eat it. Therefore, I think our habit of eating meat today is natural and reasonable.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>While I don't think eating meat can be defined as immoral, it's definitely not noble either. In my opinion, eating meat is in a gray area. People who insist eating meat is immoral consider that meat is not just meat. What they care about is the source of meat—animals. They think many animals are spiritual. They have their own emotion and consciousness similar to those of humans. The poultry and livestock we eat every day are all included in this. A lot of research also proved this view. In a profound conversation, James Randerson interviewed the animal-behavior scientist Jonathan Balcombe and get much useful cognition about animals' inner lives. In the conversation, Jonathan talked about several examples. Through research, they found that Baboons can feel grief, chickens can spot beauty, and dogs have fairness awareness. “They may not lead the same sorts of lives that we have, but they feel pleasure and pain just as intensely. They have just as acute emotional experiences as we do.” Jonathan believed it. As he said, what we eat may have similar emotional patterns to us. In fact, I do believe Jonathan’s view. I also think animals can’t be regarded as a kind of machine. However, we humans are selfish by nature. Although we regard consideration for others as a virtue, we still spontaneously consider more of ourselves. We can't make everyone think about others as much as we think about ourselves, so we always have dispute with other people. Relatively speaking, animal matters are more distant from us. It's not realistic to ask everyone to give up the existing habits for a virtue that floats in the air, although it is good. Nor can we say that it is immoral. Nathanael Johnson put forward his view in his article: “Whenever you have lots of people agreeing in principle to a goal that is impossible for most to achieve in practice, you have something resembling religion. Religions are all about setting standards that most people will never live up to.” (Johnson,2015) I agree with his view. We don't have to let not eating meat be a constraint, but rather we should let it be our freedom. We can consider more about animals and eat less meat on our own. It depends on our own attitudes and perspectives.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Another important reason why people think eating meat is immoral is not whether we eat animals, but how we treat them before we eat them. With the growing demand for meat consumption and technological advances, factory farming has become the main place to produce meat products. They keep a large number of livestocks, poultries, and fished together and manage them in a collectivized way. According to PETA organization’s condemnation, we could find lots of heartbreaking facts in factory farming: They often cut off animal’s organs such as debeaking, dehorning, and castration without painkillers; Most farmed animals have been genetically manipulated to grow larger or to produce more milk or eggs than they naturally would so that it make some animals grow so large that their legs cannot support their outsized bodies, some of them can’t walk to reach food and water. (PETA, 2021) All kinds of actions are showing us how we treat these spiritual creatures. We can accept killing these animals for our needs, but we can’t bear that we abuse them in an inhumane way. As I mentioned above, eating meat is not immoral, but it is not noble either. We can eat meat, but we can't abuse them with such peace of mind and recklessness. As creatures at the top of the food chain, we have a high level of intelligence and empathy. Since we cannot avoid eating meat, shouldn't we reduce their suffering more humanely? However, what I see is we are using our advantage to persecute them for our own benefit. I have seen that humans are wantonly depriving animals of their dignity and quality of life.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Some people may have this kind of view: “if it weren't for our needs, animals like chickens and pigs wouldn't reproduce so much. From a certain perspective, we gave them life. They should be grateful to us anyway.” I partly agree with their thought, we do promote their reproduction. However, what are they? A bunch of toys? Or some ornaments? Neither. As I mentioned above, they are creatures with emotions and perception abilities. Since we gave them life, we should make them live better rather than treat them like replicas.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>I think it is time to let go of our indifference and build a humane, comfortable for these animals that contribute their lives to us. We should slow down the pace of meat production so that we can get time and space to focus on the lives of the animals. From this perspective, eating less meat can help achieve this. Meanwhile, we need to reduce the suffering of animals when they are slaughtered. These can make the way we treat them more humane. We could eat meat according to our reasonable needs and desires, but we must improve the living environment of animals. Even death row prisoners will be well respected and treated, shouldn’t we be more kind to these animals who gave their lives for us? I hope that animals will have a better life in the future and that people will be more considerate of them. This is what we have to do when we enjoy the benefits they give. If we can actually improve their quality of life so that they can enjoy their lives as much as possible before they die, I believe people will be much less skeptical about the morality of eating meat.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Overall, in my opinion, eating meat is neither immoral nor moral. It is in the gray area. We need to consider what can be compromised and what needs to be changed.</p>
